Hi yea.... First.. this is for creatining a "System" DSN for SQL server.
Enclosed in the zip, you have two projects. 

First:
CreateDSN. vbp -  
You will have to- edit the code - using the comments in the code for instruction.
Yes the app will run as is, however it will not have your SQL server name, or
database name or your DSN Name and Description...until you edit them.
Next:
CreateEnterDSN.vbp - 
This one you use the Form to enter the data/information for creating the DSN. 
(Why not just do this in the control panel? Well, I have the same question,
I don't use this version, Maybe the answer will follow)

Neither of the above actually test the connection, so they assume (ass out of u and ass out of me) 
that all is correct. This could be added, I just never went to the trouble.
The code Does Check if the SQL driver exist and 
The code Does Check to see if the DSN name already exit. 

Why the second version: some administrators remove control panel options to keep 
users from messing with stuff and screwing up their workstation. They can carry around
in their little fix-it set this app when a new DSN is needed. Another option is to fill in the 
required text box text/data where it is visible but not allow the user to edit. 

AND one last important thing. This code sets up a Trusted SQL Connection. You'll have to make 
some revisions if you want to change this.
SMILE and Have A Great Day
